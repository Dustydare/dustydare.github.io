<p>For 51 years, Joseph Embrey had been engaged in the jewelry business in Richwood, Ohio. His father was a jeweler, and all of the sons followed the same trade. Mr. Embrey had been located in the same building in Richwood for the past twenty-six years. He had the honor of conducting one of the oldest continuous businesses in Richwood.</p>



<p>Joseph Embrey was the son of Lewis and Margaret (Bell) Embrey and was born in East Liberty, Ohio on July 1, 1855. His father was a native of Virginia, and his mother was born in Scotland. Lewis Embrey was a watchmaker and jeweler at East Liberty and lived there until his death in 1887 at the age of seventy-nine. His wife died in 1904 at the age of eighty-three. Lewis was a member of the famous &#8220;Squirrel Hunters&#8221; brigade in the Civil War. They had six children: George, Maggie, John, Victoria, Joseph, and Robert.</p>

<p>Before beginning to learn the watchmaker&#8217;s trade at the age of sixteen, Joseph spent three years working in a woolen mill. He learned the watchmaker&#8217;s and jeweler&#8217;s trade with his brother George in Morrow, Ohio. Joseph arrived in Richwood on May 29, 1878, and established a watchmaking and jewelry business at the northwest corner of Franklin and Ottawa Street (what is now Subway). He later moved to the east side of Franklin Street in 1888 where he stayed until he retired in 1931.</p>



<p>Joseph married Clara Bowers on November 11, 1883 and had two sons, Morrow and Edward. Morrow was a mechanical engineer in Milwaukee and a superintendent of a power plant there. Edward, the youngest son, was a watchmaker and helped run his father&#8217;s store for a time until his untimely death in 1930 at the age of 41. Mr. and Mrs. Embrey were members of the Methodist Episcopal church. Joseph was a church trustee and treasurer for fifteen years. He was also a member of Mount Carmel Lodge No. 303, Free and Accepted Masons, and a member of the Knights of Pythias, Rising Sun Lodge No. 71.</p>

<p>Joseph and Clara Embrey lived on East Ottawa Street, where Joseph had constructed their home in 1895. Joseph retired from his jewelry store in 1931 due to declining health. Joseph&#8217;s granddaughter, Jean, born to Morrow Embrey, was a graduate nurse and had cared for her grandfather during his illness. After a six-month battle with complications, he passed away on October 5, 1934, at the age of 79. Rev. H.M. Carpenter, a pastor of the Richwood M.E. church, conducted the funeral services at the Embrey home. Interment, under the charge of Lloyd Winter &amp; Son, was made in Claibourne cemetery. Clara Embrey later passed away on September 14, 1941, at the age of 81.</p>

<p><a href="#2023 Updates">Click here to scroll down to the latest updates.</a></p>



<p>I would like to update everyone on what&#8217;s been going on with the Richwood Opera House. For those who aren&#8217;t aware, the Opera House has been in a state of disrepair. The building has been largely unused since the early 2000s. The roof has been in danger of collapsing, the ceiling supports on the second floor have already collapsed, and the cost to repair has been very hefty. The Richwood Redevelopment Committee (RRC) was formed in October of 2020 by the Village Council. Their job has been to find ways to raise money for the Opera House and deal with the shoring up of the building and eventual restoration and renovation.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.dustinlowe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/second-floor-ceiling.jpg?resize=637%2C472&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-3243" width="637" height="472" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>This photo was taken on the second floor of the Opera House. The wood on the ground is the ceiling supports. The big long beams are the truss members that have failed. Metal rods can be seen sticking out of the hanging beams which make up part of the support of the ceiling.</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In September, the Opera House was named by Preservation Ohio as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://preserveohio.com/2020-ohios-most-endangered-historic-sites/" data-type="URL" data-id="http://preserveohio.com/2020-ohios-most-endangered-historic-sites/" target="_blank">2020 Ohio&#8217;s Most Endangered Historic Site</a>. The first meeting of the RRC was on October 22, 2020. The committee includes Reddy Brown, Chairperson; Aaron Smith, Vice Chairperson; Gail DeGood-Guy, Secretary; R. Shandel, Treasurer. The committee also makes up 11 voting members. They started by defining the objectives and challenges of the committee. Different age groups view the Opera House in different ways. On one end: Younger age groups may not even know it exists. On the other end: Many older citizens grew up in the Opera House. This project of dealing with a dilapidated historic building that holds sentimental value to many citizens of Richwood  is unique and we&#8217;re exploring new waters with it. </p>



<p>The first step was to establish different options on how to deal with the building and present them to the Village Council to decide. The short term plan was established first. Quotes from various contractors were received to shore up the roof for the winter. Then they established a long term plan such as do they want to simply tear it down, preserve some or all of the building, move the Village offices back inside the building, or even sell the building out to companies, venues, ect. Grants were also discussed since these would largely be responsible for funding the project. </p>

<p>There are four sections to the building. The west tower contains offices and the clock. The center had with fire dept. and gym and is the worst damaged area. In the east section, two bays are used to house Village stop light equipment. And the basement which appears to be in fairly good shape. There are three main areas of concern: the building needs a new roof, structural issues need to be dealt with, and the brick needs to be repointed. New stairwells are also needed and it needs to be ADA compliant which includes constructing an elevator. The motion was made and moved forward with getting sealed bids. </p>



<p>It was stressed that since the building is historic, the slate roof should be as original as possible. It doesn&#8217;t necessarily has to be slate but the roof line should be kept close with its original line. The large federal grants are only available for places that are registered with the National Register of Historic Places. Aaron Smith took upon himself to start this process. Parking was also talked about and the Richwood-North Union Public Library, which is located across the street, is willing to partner with the Village to use their parking. </p>

<p>On December 15, 2020, State. Rep. Tracy Richardson (R-Marysville) announced state lawmakers began hearings today on Ohio’s proposed two-year state construction budget, which includes funding for a variety of initiatives across the state as well as aid for local projects in Marion and Union counties. In these local projects included funding for the Richwood Opera House. The Village received $50,000 after this bill, named Senate Bill 310, was passed on December 29. Meanwhile, five different companies were considered and/or gave bids to shore up the roof. Two companies were over budget at $100,000 to complete the work. Two companies were under budget of less than $97,000 using Derwacter structural engineering guidelines. Meyer Restoration, with an $89,100 bid to remove all the debris and install shoring per Derwacter, was selected by the committee to present to the Village Council to proceed.</p>



<p>On December 14, 2020, Village Council voted to keep and restore the full building to use for Village government, police, museum, community hall/venue, resiliency center, community services and/or offices. The council also voted to hire Meyer Restoration, with an $89,100 bid to remove all the debris and install shoring per Derwacter, to shore up the roof. According to Derwacter, the floor should handle the load of the scaffolding. However, to be extra safe, Meyer Restoration will use a measuring device to ensure the floor can maintain the scaffolding weight. The approximate additional cost for the device is $2,000. Work on shoring up the roof began on January 18, 2021. The company started by cleaning up the downed ceiling. Next up was to use the shoring to shore up the broken truss enough to cut it away safely. The next week the shoring was built toward the weak beam to help hold it up. The measuring system, transit, targets, and checksheets was installed as the last scaffold was put into place on February 8. The total cost for Meyer Restoration was $91,208: $60,228 to shore up the roof, $16,900 for the scaffolding (which the village will then own) and $14,080 for a rubber roof, antenna removal &amp; measuring machine.</p>

<p>A phased work schedule was drafted by the committee. This was further elaborated on when they created a timeline for their paperwork to receive the capital funds via S.B. 310. The project was expected to take three years to complete, 2021-2023. As of October 2022, the Richwood Redevelopment Committee was planning on working with their contracted feasibility study vendor, Raising the Barr LLC, to plan for and conduct a fundraising analysis. However, Sarah Barr, owner of the company, is no longer available to conduct the study. Michael Hurwitz from Telesolve Company in Reynoldsburg, who was a candidate for the financial feasibility study, expressed interest in working with the committee again. The committee hopes to meet with Hurwitz at a regular meeting in January or at a special meeting to accommodate his availability. The job of the feasibility study is to ask various people and businesses of Richwood if they would be willing to donate money and resources. They will inform the committee of the anticipated ratio of individual gifts, corporate gifts and grants that will be used in the construction phases of the project. This study will also inform the committee of how many phases of work that the construction project will take (which depends entirely on how much funds the committee has at a time to pay for the work). During this period, an Architecture &amp; Engineering firm will be identified via bid process and contracted to more fully inform a detailed design of the building.</p>



<p>If you would like to donate to the Richwood Redevelopment Committee, there are various ways you may do so. Below are some of the ways that you can donate and contribute financial support to the work on the Opera House:</p>

<p>As of now, there is still some hesitation in moving the village government back into the Opera House. The police have stated that they do not wish to move and the village council is unwilling to pay and occupy both buildings. Further plans will need to be assessed in regard to what the building will be utilized for. The feasibility study, as of April 2022, has yet to start. A few unexpected issues need to be addressed first. The Opera House will need to have a rubber roof installed to prevent further water damage. It was also found that the clock tower is in danger due to water damage and will need to be addressed as well. Because of this, the committee is in desperate need of funds. </p>



<p>The S.B. 310, which will give the committee $50,000, is still expected to be received. They only need to complete Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 form to identity and assess any effect on other historic buildings in the area while restoring the Richwood Opera House. Once that form is through, they can process the request for capital funds. Tracy Plouck, committee member, spoke with Sen. Bill Reineke&#8217;s aide and requested an updated application of $170,000 from the 2022 capital budget.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>In October of 2022, the committee recently met virtually with TRIAD Architects and independent contractors to discuss the conceptual design for the former opera house and municipal building. The proposed first floor design includes offices for the clerk and mayor, a community space, a council meeting room, a lobby, a break room, restrooms, a computer storage room, an open office area, a records storage room, a multi-use space and a community resources room. Additionally, there would be a vestibule through the main entrance with double doors. Other design elements are wooden floors, acoustic ceiling baffles to absorb sound and an elevator.</p>



<p>In a regular meeting, Vice Chairman Aaron expressed concern about the open office space intended for the zoning inspector and the village administrator. &#8220;In my opinion, I think the mayor is one of the people who probably doesn&#8217;t need an office because it&#8217;s kind of a part-time gig.&#8221; He explained that he does not want to assume the village administrator will always be the police chief, although Monte Asher currently fills both roles. The committee discussed not designating the offices for particular positions, except for the fiscal officer.</p>



<p>Additionally, there was some adversity from the mayor and village administrator in previous discussions with the village council about moving offices to the opera house building on South Franklin Street. The current officials prefer to keep the municipal building with the police department at 153 N. Franklin St. As the restoration won&#8217;t be completed for a decade or so, the committee stressed the importance of flexibility in the structure, such as movable walls, for different needs in the future. The second floor will feature an event space that could be rented for weddings or other large gatherings. The team at TRIAD Architects said the existing wood floor could be salvaged with repairs. The conceptual design also incorporates a 30-by-12 foot stage. The designers plan to repurpose the south side fire escape railing for an interior staircase. There will also be a bridal suite and catering kitchen upstairs.</p>



<p>At this time, the projector room and clock tower will remain untouched. The committee plans to retain the existing brick walls and foundation as well. Committee Chairman Reddy Brown and member Laurie Eliot-Shea expressed that they are trying to keep the as much of the original building as possible. </p>



<p>The cost of the restoration is estimated to be $1.9 million which includes the downstairs renovation, upstairs renovation, new shingled roof covering, HVAC and new electrical systems on both floors, updated safety systems, and an elevator. The unofficial quote includes $200,000 in construction contingency. Brown said the work will proceed in phases as the funding is available. Furthermore, the quote does not include furnishings as well as an additional $110,000 for an asphalt roof. The final quote and design are expected in the coming weeks. </p>



<h1>2023 Updates<a name="2023 Updates"></a></h1>



<p>At a recent committee meeting, Reddy Brown, chair of the Richwood Revitalization Committee, said that Mayor Scott Jerew asked him to repair the clock attached to the Opera House. Reddy told members that he would research how much it will cost to repair it. There is a maintenance fund in the village&#8217;s general budget for the building provided the village council approves the expenditure to repair the clock. If the council does not provide the funding, the committee will need to budget for an electrician to correct the building&#8217;s electrical circuit. </p>



<p>Vice chair Aaron Smith has also been documenting the clock&#8217;s history. He explained that some information regarding the Seth Thomas Clock Company has been lost and a volume is missing from the National Watch and Clock Museum in Pennsylvania. </p>



<p>The committee was able to raise a total of $549 since the November meeting. The Village Council paid Triad Architects roughly $34,000 for their work on a conceptual design of the building. The committee will eventually refund the council when it receives the 2020 capital funds. A grand agreement was submitted to the State Controlling Board for approval to receive the funds. </p>



<p>The committee has also agreed to pursue the hiring of Michael Hurwitz of the Telesolve Company out of Reynoldsburg to begin a feasibility study. Hurwitz has worked on several restoration projects around Ohio such as the Holland Theatre in Bellefontaine and the opera house in West Liberty. The committee has about $8,000 for the study and Hurwitz told the group he would charge $5,000 in total — $2,500 up front and another $2,500 when completed. </p>



<p>Hurwitz&#8217;s job is to help the committee evaluate the potential financial contributions needed from the community. The project would have to be funded with a 20/80 split. 80% would come from public/private and grant funds and 20% would come from the community. The amount of community support would be between $250,000 and $400,000. The village is looking at a total cost of the project to be over $2 million. Hurwitz would conduct a series of community impact surveys and put together possible donors to be interviewed. The study would also explore options for community partnerships, naming rights, and other incentives. Hurwitz gave a date of June 1 to have all the interviews and surveys completed. He assured the group that the committee is on the right track and said that the opera house project has &#8220;lots of potential.&#8221; </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>Committee members and Mayor Scott Jerew were expecting more information and guidance following the results of the feasibility study which was finally complete after many months of waiting. Scott&#8217;s hope was to hear more about what the financial picture would look like for restoring the building. He has concern about raising the money which he hoped would be clarified at the end of the study. Jerew pointed out that the fundraising thermometer on the wall, which was there before the fair in 2022, had yet to reach the goal of $5,000. &#8220;We haven&#8217;t made that goal here yet. Doesn&#8217;t that bother anyone on this group? It sure should.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hurwitz, whose company had conducted the feasibility study, told the committee that, in his opinion, the community would not be able to restore it, but could reclaim it and have a new use. The cost would come at around $3 million with 40-60% coming from the community itself. He added that &#8220;technically&#8221; saving the building is possible. &#8220;There&#8217;s no right or wrong answer here, it&#8217;s what the community wants to do. It&#8217;s what the community is committed to do,&#8221; Hurwitz said. He pointed out that the building is structurally sound enough to save.</p>



<p>The study consisted of interviewing 30 members of the community with the goal of seeing who might be willing to contribute financially. He said the results were surprising in that a small number of people, less than 10, said they were either indifferent or didn&#8217;t think the project was possible. Hurwitz pointed out that it is not unanimous that we are going to save it, preserve it, do what we want to do with it. He said out of the 30 people that were interviewed, 23 were committed to doing the project in some form. He told the committee that the study was conducted with a theatrical perspective, meaning he could tell the group what the building needed in order to be the event center the committee wants it to be. He said he would be happy to supply additional information regarding finances. </p>



<p>By the end of the meeting, the committee decided to review the 200 page binder that Hurwitz provided and would present his findings to the village council with more specific goals on what to do next. Hurwitz added that he would be willing to reach out to larger local businesses but stressed that the committee must get more money in the bank first.</p>



<p>After an almost three-hour meeting, committee members reached a consensus on the specifics of their recommendation to the village council which they presented at the next regular session on July 24. The committee recommended to proceed with saving the opera house. Since the committee was formed in 2020, they have received nearly $150,000 in grant money which has gone toward small roof repairs and the feasibility study. While the committee hasn&#8217;t technically entered the fundraising stage, members have high hopes that funds can be found if it moves forward.</p>



<p>At the village council meeting on July 24, 2023, the council decided to allow the Opera House Committee to continue their work, provided they adhere to a few stipulations. Some council members were reluctant with the repairs and had suggestions and questions for the committee. Council member Pat Morse, who has been vocal about his reluctance regarding the opera house restoration, noted the committee hasn&#8217;t shown him much that would change his mind. He pointed out how the Richwood Park improvements have increased business and brought people to town, &#8220;This park that you guys have done here is fantastic. That&#8217;s bringing people to town. That&#8217;s what we need to do. I don&#8217;t think remodeling that thing in 20 years, for $2-5 million at this point, is going to do what that park&#8217;s doing.&#8221;</p>



<p>Committee members asked Morse what he would do instead and he suggested to keep the clock tower, demolish the rest of the opera house and turn it into a green space. Council member Von Beal had similar opinions about setting up a nonprofit and getting the building out of the village&#8217;s responsibility. Council member Reddy Brown responded that they had looked into it. Doing so would push the burden of the building, which includes a hefty insurance bill, to the committee. The committee of course not having as many funds to handle the bills. </p>



<p>Committee members were committed to continuing their work noting that they currently have $150,000 in grants which can be used to help stabilize the roof even more making the north side of the building structurally sound. According to the feasibility report, around $900,000 of the $2.9 million required will be needed by residents with the other amount coming from grants. Mayor Scott Jerew suggested the committee fix the rood and then go to residents, such as at the Richwood Fair, and ask what they would be willing to give to support the project. &#8220;Continue on the path and bring back some information maybe after the fair, see what the community support is.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Since the church in front of the cemetery is now for sale, I thought it would be prudent to offer a history of the lot. The first person to be buried in the cemetery was Jane Mary Brookins, daughter of J.P. Brookins. The story goes as follows:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Jane Mary, the little daughter and only child of Dr. and Mrs. Brookins, was playing with her cousins, William and John Woods, and each had a fire. Jane Mary&#8217;s was burning well, but the boys could not get theirs to burn and asked to make them burn. She took her apron to fan the fire and sat down over some hot coals that had scattered, and her clothing took fire from them. Before help could reach her, she was so badly burned that she died in a few hours.&#8221;</p>
<cite>A Voice From the Past by W.H. Frank</cite></blockquote>



<p>Philip Plummer, the founder of Richwood, owned the plat and allowed the child to be buried there. He helped clear off the ground and dig the grave for said child. The graveyard grew throughout the years just as Richwood had grown. The cemetery had ceased to be used by around 1860. Some remains were even transferred to the Claibourne cemetery which is now the widely used cemetery in the area. In fact, the Richwood Gazette reported in 1877 how the old lot was full of weeds high enough to hide the tombstones; they implored the Trustees of the township to pay more attention to the place. The burial ground even became a hangout spot for young adults in the town who refused to stay out of trouble. </p>

<p>The First Baptist Church of Richwood received permission by the Trustees of Claibourne township to lease the lot and build their church in front of the cemetery on Ottawa street for a term of 99 years. The congregation would pay one dollar to the treasury of Claibourne Township with the stipulation that the church keep both the building and the graveyard in good repair and to have a fence constructed to enclose the lots. If at anytime the church building shall cease to be used as a house of worship by said Baptist society, then the lot shall become the property of Claibourne township once again.</p>



<p>In 1889, 57 years after Richwood was founded, the heirs of Philip Plummer claimed that since the ground was no longer used for cemetery purposes, it should revert back to the original owner, Philip Plummer. They had brought a suit against the Baptist Church to compel them to pay for the land. The amount they claimed was $200.</p>



<p>On Monday, December 9, 1889, the trial began in the Marysville Courthouse at one o&#8217;clock p.m. John Graham was the first witness. He came to Richwood in 1886. He knew Philip Plummer well, and told the court of his good ways but wasn&#8217;t as specific with times and places and others were. Elder Swartz was the next witness and was well acquainted with the ground on which Richwood now stands. He was present at the time, in 1832, that Plummer drove into what is now the original town plat and saw them unload the surveyor&#8217;s tools that were used in laying off the town. In 1838, he (Swartz) heard Plummer say that he would not disturb the graves that had been made on the lots called the graveyard in Richwood; that he had given them to the people, and they had buried on them by his permission and should not be disturbed. He also told of the first grave that had been dug there, Jane Mary Brookins, and that he had burned his hands in trying to help extinguish the fire.</p>

The tombstone leaning against the tree is the one that belongs to Jane Mary Brookins. Her exact burial place is unknown, the tombstone being moved from it&#8217;s original position.</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>John A.J. Tonguet next took the stand. His age was 83. He also met Plummer in the woods when he came to lay out the town. His uncle, George Clark, took a contract from Plummer to clear and fence the three acres of land immediately east of Richwood and lying between the Prospect and the Hoskins pikes. Uncle George Clark and Nathaniel and John A.J. Tonguet did the work; and when they were ready to commence to make the fence, Plummer came to help lay out the fence row, and the question was asked if the fence should be on the survey line or not. Plummer responded with, &#8220;No; I own the land in both surveys, and I want the fence put on the line of the graveyard and other lots, and let the driveway, or the strip of land between the corporation line on the east and west line of the Bull of Claibourne survey be inside the field and the graveyard lots outside.&#8221; They then set the stakes for the fence by the stakes of the lots of the town. This was in 1835.</p>



<p>William H. Ferguson came next. He produced a deed from Plummer for two unrelated lots that were turned back to Plummer in 1849 by act of the Legislature, and the facts were set up in the deed.</p>



<p>L. Myers came to Richwood in the spring of 1842, and buried his children in the lots.</p>



<p>John Phillips was born in Richwood in 1836 and remembered Plummer and the graveyard lots well.</p>



<p>Asa Langstaff was a Trustee of Claibourne Township and as such made the lease of the lots to the church. This testimony was most all taken in writing on Monday. The stipulations of which is explained above.</p>



<p>Tuesday morning, the court came and H.C. Hamilton was put on the stand. For an hour or more, he told the story of Richwood and the old settlers to an audience of forty or more, mostly lawyers, who gave the best of attention, and now and then indulged in a smile as some peculiar part came to light. He knew Plummer and all his family. He went to school with the older children and knew the younger ones as well. Plummer left Richwood in 1842, early in the fall. He returned on a visit in 1843, during the Millerite movement and the Second Great Awakening that never came. </p>

<p>Plummer came back to Richwood as a minister of the Methodist Episcopal church in the fall of 1849 and stayed for two years. The people used the Richwood burying ground when H.C. Hamilton left home, in 1853, and they had to a great extent abandoned the use of it when he returned in 1859. The late Joshua S. Gill got the field east of town and the lots west of the graveyard and fenced them all as one piece of land and used the graveyard lots as a pasture field to connect the field and his house and lots.</p>



<p>In the spring of 1864, the late William Hamilton bought Gill out. Hamilton did not own the lots and lands long before he sold them to Edward Norris. Norris abandoned the field and laid it off in town lots. From this on the graveyard was neglected, and it became an immense weed patch up until in was leased to the Baptist church. Under control of the church, the graveyard for a time became a pleasant place to go and look upon. The case was decided that the church would still hold possession of the lots. It had continued to stay in possession of the people of Richwood just as Philip Plummer wanted.</p>



<p>Since then the church had changed congregations a few times until now. The building has been largely renovated and is now for sale. The graveyard, however, continues to be neglected just as it was over 160 years ago.</p>

<p>While Magnetic Springs was famous for it’s healing mineral water, Richwood was no stranger to these discoveries. Mineral water was thought to provide many benefits. By the 19th century, thermal resorts had become fashionable destinations for those who wished to bathe and enjoy the therapeutic benefits of mineral water. Many hoped to find miracle cures for their ailments.</p>



<p>The C.D. Sidle farm in Richwood was located slightly west of the fairgrounds. In 1899, the Richwood Oil, Gas, and Mineral Company, of which a man named J.L. Horn was president, awarded a contract to an experienced driller from Lima, Ohio for the drilling of two test oil wells on the land of Mr. Sidle. Under the terms of the agreement, the contract price for the drilling of the first well was 95 cents per foot until the hole was 100 feet provided oil or gas was not found. If none was discovered, the drilling would continue until the company wishes to stop and the contractor would be paid $1.25 for each foot drilled. While oil or gas was never found, something else entirely was discovered. </p>



<p>On September 19, 1899, the oil well reached a depth of 1652 feet when a vein of mineral water was struck. Dr. L.L. Roebuck was sent to Columbus with a sample of the water to have it analyzed. He went directly to Curtis C. Howard who was a professor of chemistry at the Starling Medical College. Howard said the water was strongly charged with minerals and began analyzing it straight away. Although quite a number of people were disappointed that no oil was found, the board of directors admitted that if it is indeed mineral water, it would be worth more money than an oil or gas well. A few days after the drilling, the water raised in the well to a depth of 1200 feet and it may have eventually overflowed. </p>



<p>At the oil drilling meeting held at the mayor’s office on the 26th of September, 1899, a large list of shareholders were present and it was decided to drill another well. The shareholders were required to pay in the last half of their assessment no later than Oct. 7 of that year. As soon as sufficient funds were raised, a contract would be made for the drilling of the second well. The analysis of the water had not yet been received by Prof. Howard at the time. However, in a letter that the professor wrote to Dr. Roebuck a few days prior, he mentioned that the water contained valuable medicinal properties and requested that the doctor wait until a thorough chemical test could be made.</p>



<p>A few days later, the results had finally arrived of a thorough quantitative analysis of the water from Richwood’s abandoned oil well. He submitted the result of his investigations to the directors of the Richwood Oil, Gas, and Mineral Company in the following letter:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">GENTLEMEN : - The sample of deep well water received from you gives on analysis the following figures:
Sodium Sulphate.................................................145.2
Sodium Chloride................................................1465.1
Calcium Chloride.................................................80.6
Calcium Bicarbonate..............................................77.3
Magnesium Bicarbonate............................................80.9
Aluminum Sulphate................................................21.6
                                                               ______
                                                               1870.7
Sulphuretted Hydrogen..............................24.3 cubic inches.
                       Yours Truly,
                               Curtis C. Howard</pre>



<p>In transmitting his report, Professor Howard said: &#8220;The water contains a considerable amount of sodium chloride present. The calcium chloride is also considerable and the aluminum sulphate is unusually high. The water certainly possesses a sufficiently large amount of mineral constituents to entitle it to be called mineral water.&#8221; Professor Howard’s area of expertise was of course to simply determine the chemical composition of the water and it was not a part of his duty to express an opinion as to its medical value. The proportion of sulphuretted hydrogen in this water, as compared with other sulpher waters, is shown in the following table:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">Sulphuretted hydrogen gas in cubic inches per U.S. gal.
Weilbach Well, Germany............................................1.161
Cave Well, Chittenago, N.Y........................................2.754
White Sulphur Well, Chittenago, N.Y...............................0.884
Florida Well, Montgomery Co., N.Y.................................3.765
Odevene Spring, Delaware, Ohio....................................2.924
Richwood Well, Richwood, Ohio......................................24.3</pre>



<p>The Odevene spring of Delaware is still located on Ohio Wesleyan University&#8217;s campus. The sulphur spring well, which has since dried up, has been turned into a well-known gathering spot for students and faculty. The well only contained 2.9 cubic inches of sulphuretted hydrogen per gallon, while the water from the Richwood well contained over eight times as much of this gas, which was one of its most valuable properties. </p>



<p>In October of 1899, the drilling commenced on the second well on William Biddle’s farm located near the first well west of Richwood. As expected, it too proved to be a &#8220;dry&#8221; hole after drilling 1500 feet and was promptly abandoned. Mr. and Mrs. Biddle entertained the four men on the drilling crew at their home when the drilling was complete. Three of the men were Welsh along with Mrs. Biddle who was of Welsh parentage. The evening was spent in the singing of Welsh songs with Mr. Jones, captain of the drilling crew, acting as pianist. Oysters and other refreshments were served. </p>

<p>In December, the Richwood, Oil, Gas and Mineral Company met at the mayor&#8217;s office once more and it was decided to organize a stock company for the development of well number 1 on the Sidle farm and put the mineral water on the market. The company was capitalized in the sum of $10,000 and the stock was sold to the members of the Richwood OGM Co. for $10 each as long as any member of the old company wished to do so. After which, it was offered to the rest of the public. </p>



<p>On December 18, 1899, the Varuna Water Company filed their articles of incorporation to the Ohio Secretary of State and began to develop well no. 1 of the old Richwood Oil, Gas, and Mineral Company. The water was named “Varuna” which is a Sanskrit word meaning “the God of Waters.” On December 28, 1899, the stockholders of Varuna Water Company met at the private office of the Deposit Bank in Richwood. After some time, a committee consisting of J.B. Miller, J.M. Wilkins, and George W. Worden was appointed to draft the by-laws and constitution. After they were met with approval, the following list of officers were elected: J.L. Horn, president; J.M. Wilkins, vice president; W.H. Wagers, secretary; and Bent Cahill, treasurer.</p>



<p>The Varuna Water Company contracted with a Baltimore firm for a bottling machine which was placed in the building constructed on the land purchased from C.D. Sidle. The Richwood Gazette published the following story: On February 12, 1900, the president of the Varuna Water Company, J.L. Horn, had opened an airtight lid to one of the big tanks filled with the water. Upon doing so, sulphonated hydrogen gas was so strong that it completely overcame him, and he stepped back from the tank and gently laid down on the floor. As he dropped, his hat fell to the first story of the building where his men were working and went upstairs to see what was wrong. They were surprised to see Mr. Horn lying on the floor sleeping as sweetly as a baby. They attempted to awake him, but it was about five minutes before they could do so. When he finally came to, he said he felt as though he had been chloroformed and that he believed he would have slept longer had he been left alone.<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote modern-footnotes-footnote--hover-on-desktop ">1</sup></p>



<p>Varuna water began to sell at the stores of J.L. Horn and Isaac Miller in Richwood. The bottles were sold for 25 cents per gallon. Anyone with stomach, liver, or kidney pain was suggested to try the water. An advertisement in the Richwood Gazette suggested that “If you have that tired feeling and don’t enjoy your food, try Varuna mineral water. It will sharpen up your appetite and make a new man of you.”<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote modern-footnotes-footnote--hover-on-desktop ">2</sup></p>

<p>On April 17, 1900, the Varuna Water Company made a big shipment of mineral water to their agent, J.W. Thew, at Marion. It was later said that J.B. Miller made arrangements to sell the water in Columbus.</p>



<p>The Richwood Gazette, in their paper on April 19, 1900, claimed that Austin Rose, of west Ottawa St., was surprised to find a full-grown opossum sunning himself on his front porch. Mr. Rose captured it alive and expected to keep it until next summer and then turn it over to the Varuna Water Company for their zoological garden. This was the only mention of such a garden which may or may not have existed.</p>



<p>In June of 1900, the Varuna Water Company began carbonating the water to make it more pleasant and less “nauseating as it was in its natural state.” The carbonating claimed to not destroy its rare medical properties but instead “keeps it pure and makes it sparkle like champagne.”<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote modern-footnotes-footnote--hover-on-desktop ">3</sup></p>

<p>In September 1900, J.L. Horn sold the company over to Isaac Miller. Mr. Miller began extensive improvements, one of which was the creation of a modern bath house. Varuna Park, including the bath house, opened as a pleasure resort at the end of May 1901. The bath house included eight bath rooms, with male and female attendants. Wooden tubs were used for those desiring baths in Varuna well no. 1 since it was claimed that no other material should be used on account of the properties of the water. In the rooms used by well no. 2, porcelain tubs were used. The park itself was fitted with seats, swings and merry-go-rounds. Refreshments were also served on the grounds. It was reported that over 800 people visited the park on its opening day on May 19, 1901.</p>



<p>In June, Mr. Miller began making arrangements to give band concerts at the park every Sunday afternoon during the summer months beginning on June 29 when Prof. Arens, of LaRue, assisted by the LaRue Cornet Band, opened the season. The public was invited to enjoy the “cool and sparkling mineral water to their hearts’ content.”<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote modern-footnotes-footnote--hover-on-desktop ">4</sup> No admission to the park was charged.</p>



<p>A new 40-horsepower boiler was purchased for the water plant in July after the old boiler let loose one Sunday morning and blew out one of the heads. Nobody was in the engine room at the time and Mr. Miller was glad that no one was around when the boiler gave out.</p>

<p>Varuna Park opened for the season on Saturday, June 7, 1902, in the form of a gala day. At 10 o’clock a.m. a grand parade took place in which 100 men on horseback, representing different nationalities, escorted by two brass bands, traversed along the streets of town, and arrived at the park by 11 o’clock. Professional Perry, the high wire wonder, who was famous for juggling, dancing, and riding a bicycle across an ordinary steel wire in midair, was present. Charles G. Parker and “Stump,” his educated dog, was also on the grounds. “Stump” climbed a 50-foot ladder and jumped to a net below. This was purported to have been the highest jump ever made by a trained dog at the time. The two brass bands continued to provide music throughout the day. At 3 o’clock, the attractions at the park were moved to Franklin Street in Richwood where programs were rendered during the evening. All jugs and bottles brought by guests were filled with Varuna water, free of charge. Arrangements were made where anyone could secure excursion rates from any point on the Erie railroad.</p>



<p>In November of 1903, Isaac Miller was forced to declare bankruptcy. His liabilities were about $24,000 with assets of about $10,000. He came to Richwood in 1880 and actively engaged in many businesses. He conducted a successful business and owned considerable real estate up until about three years before the bankruptcy, about the time he purchased Varuna Park and made an effort to improve the park and put Varuna water on the market. The sales of the plant since then were not what they should’ve been and the expenses were very heavy, thereby involving him to such an extent that he was forced to take out money from his other businesses just to keep Varuna Park going. The stock of merchandise formally owned by Mr. Miller was sold in a bankruptcy sale on December 29, 1903. His seventy-two shares of stock in the Varuna Water Co. were sold to Miller&#8217;s nephew from Cleveland.</p>

<p>The land known as Varuna Park continued to be owned by Isaac Miller. On December 23, 1909, Mr. Miller sold ten acres off the south half of Varuna Park to H.H. Beaner who owned the Sidle farm adjoining the park grounds. On May 25, 1916, Mr. Miller sold the Varuna Park to D.C. and James Cushman of Richwood and Max Meyer of Columbus. They installed a fertilizer plant there named the Richwood Fertilizer Company. D.C. Cushman was manager of the establishment and had full charge of the business. A lawsuit was later brought to the company by a Dr. Bown. It was postponed indefinitely on account of the owners agreeing to cease operations of the plant by April 1, 1918. The suit was brought on to prevent the draining of wastewater from the plant into Fulton Creek and to stop the offensive odors.</p>



<p>Varuna Park had continued to be used as a gathering place for the citizens of Richwood. Many picnics and public sales were still being held on the grounds. The Park was used until at least the 1930s. After that time, all mention of Varuna Park ceased, and both the park and the mineral water had faded into obscurity.</p>
