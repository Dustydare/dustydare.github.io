He learned the watchmaker&#8217;s and jeweler&#8217;s trade with his brother George in Morrow, Ohio. Joseph arrived in Richwood on May 29, 1878, and established a watchmaking and jewelry business at the northwest corner of Franklin and Ottawa Street (what is now Subway). He later moved to the east side of Franklin Street in 1888 where he stayed until he retired in 1931.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joseph married Clara Bowers on November 11, 1883 and had two sons, Morrow and Edward. Morrow was a mechanical engineer in Milwaukee and a superintendent of a power plant there. Edward, the youngest son, was a watchmaker and helped run his father&#8217;s store for a time until his untimely death in 1930 at the age of 41. Mr. and Mrs. Embrey were members of the Methodist Episcopal church. Joseph was a church trustee and treasurer for fifteen years. He was also a member of Mount Carmel Lodge No. 303, Free and Accepted Masons, and a member of the Knights of Pythias, Rising Sun Lodge No. 71.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignright size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.dustinlowe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/1910-Embry-House.jpg?resize=461%2C303&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4044\" style=\"width:461px;height:303px\" width=\"461\" height=\"303\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.dustinlowe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/1910-Embry-House.jpg?w=792&amp;ssl=1 792w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.dustinlowe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/1910-Embry-House.jpg?resize=300%2C197&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.dustinlowe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/1910-Embry-House.jpg?resize=768%2C505&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.dustinlowe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/1910-Embry-House.jpg?resize=700%2C460&amp;ssl=1 700w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.dustinlowe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/1910-Embry-House.jpg?resize=400%2C263&amp;ssl=1 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>The Embrey House, located on East Ottawa St. and erected in 1895 by Joseph Embrey.
