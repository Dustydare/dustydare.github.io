He later served two terms as treasurer for Richwood and two terms as treasurer of Union county. Afterward, he purchased the Marion Transcript newspaper, which changed its name to the Marion Republican. After about a year, he sold the Marion Republican and bought the LaRue News which he edited for about a year before moving back to Richwood and engaged in the fire insurance business. His health became an issue which prompted him to quit this business and served as a rural mail carrier on route 5 out of Richwood. He was married to Miss Minnie Beem on Thanksgiving Day in 1884 until Thanksgiving of 1907 when Minnie passed away due to breast cancer. After her death, he always seemed to be exceedingly sad and rarely left his residence. He devoted most of his time taking care of his sister who stayed with him. Mr. Smith had suffered a stroke of paralysis and passed away on September 12, 1909 at 55 years of age. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reportedly eighty people had subscribed to the Association at one point. A membership fee of $3.00 was required to join; of which amount $2.50 was expended for the purchase of new books and book cases, and the additional 50 cents allowed for their share of the incidental expenses. It is unknown how long the Association lasted before an official public library was finally established. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Richwood Public Library as we know it was formed on January 26, 1915 with the organization of the first library board.
